[Work In Progress] Project is stable but currently only has a few of the exercises (3) converted, track the remaining here: https://github.com/kealjones-wk/ap_over_react/pull/1
# AP OverReact: Advanced Patterns in OverReact

These exercises are OverReact versions of the React exercises from https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns.
It is expected to follow along with the videos in that course while doing these exercises to get the full benefit,
even though it is not a 1 to 1 the concepts are the same and if you ever get stuck take a look at exercises-final to see
how it was done.

## Requires Dart 2
Although this is currently built with dart1 and dart2 compatible components, this project is meant for dart 2.

## Get Started
1. First, you'll need to run `pub get`.
2. Then run `webdev serve --hot-reload`.
3. Open Chrome to http://localhost:8080
4. Navigate to the `lib/src/exercises` directory and get started by editing `01.dart`, and because this is dart 2 all changes you make will automatically hot reload in your browser!
